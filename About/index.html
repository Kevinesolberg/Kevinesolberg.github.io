          <p>I always knew I wanted to do something with history, but I never thought I would wind up in a GIS program. When I started my BA at Augsburg College, I was under the assumption that "real" history equated to lengthy prose. As far as I was concerned, good history belonged on paperâ€”preferably paper covered in footnotes.</p>
          <p>My thesis dealt with "public sex" between men, the spaces where this conduct occurred, and the resulting  battle with neighborhood activists, anti-pornography feminists, and municipal authorities. Since most of this conduct took place in Minneapolis' pornographic theaters and bookstores, the location of these placesâ€”especially their proximity to residential neighborhoodsâ€”became of paramount importance. Were these to be hetero-normative spaces, or queer spaces? Who would decide? These questions racked the Minneapolis gay community in the 1980s. My question, however, soon became how to frame this conflict and how to present it. As the scope of the project increased, the traditional monograph looked less and less suited for the task.That assumption did not last long. An honors thesis rooted in the intersections of urban spaces and sexuality, coupled with my internship at the Historyapolis Project, fundamentally changed my perception of how to construct and present historical narratives.</p>
          <p>I became convinced that GIS offered a powerful tool in interpreting and presenting this multifaceted conflict. The result of my thesis project soon morphed into a collection of presentations. I wrote several blog posts about the anti-pornography feminist movement coupled with a series of maps showing the location of pornographic sites frequented by gay men. A more traditional journal article for the Middle West Review explored the differences between sexual acts and sexual identity. This, in turn, cast new light on the previous posts and maps.The article, blog posts, and interactive maps, combined to create a multi-disciplinary project that was more than the sum of its parts. Each piece could stand alone, but together, they offered a far richer picture of the Minneapolis Sex Wars than a monolithic essay could achieve.</p>
          <p>That experience carried over into my work with the Historyapolis project. As we uncovered vast amounts of visual sources in the City's various archives, I suddenly found myself dealing with non-traditional types of source material. The challenge became interpreting that material for a much broader audience than the committee for my thesis defense. I began geo-referencing historical maps and embedding them on the Historyapolis website using the Google Maps API. After uncovering a guide to gay "cruising" sites in Minneapolisâ€”published in a 1970 issue of the radical bi-weekly Hundred Flowersâ€”I began using GIS software to find a way to translate the text into a map. The result was one of the larger successes on Historyapolis and further whetted my appetite for navigating the intersections of physical space and historical narrative.</p>
          <p>I remain convinced that I need to do something with history. The shape that work will take, however, has shifted. I eventually came to believe that GIS was far more promising and offered a wider variety of applications and tools for a historian interested in public, as well as academic, history.</p>
          <p>I am now in the master of geographic information science program at the University of Minnesota, where I continue the work I have started in exploring the connections between geography, history, and interpretation.</p>
